                <p>Acting as an education center and social space, the Tianjin Binhai Library is a unique building with<br>a dominant spherical auditorium. When looking in at the library from the outside, the oval cut-out mixed with the giant sphere creates an "eye" unifying the outside with the inside. The horizontal<br>metal lines that make up the rest of the exterior, helps guide the viewer's eye towards the center of<br>the building where the sphere lies. In the inside is a bright and open area filled with books ceiling high, that welcomes whoever enters.</p>

            <div id="libraryPara2">
                <p>When entering the Tianjin Binhai library, the eye automatically goes towards the sphere in the center. Using its scale, shape, and colour, the sphere utilizes hierarchy to draw attention to it. The wall<br>and stairs that surrounds the auditorium features both real books, which line the walls, along with painted books to simulate a typical library. The white lights that line the bookshelves, makes the space feel more open and bigger. The walls and ceilings are also curved giving the inside more movement and creating an emphasis on the auditorium in the middle.</p>

                <p>When looking for the four design methodologies that MVRDV uses, viewers can clearly see where they begin and where they end. Activator can be seen from the spherical auditorium. The emphasis placed on it by the oval<br>cut-out on the outside, and the curved walls and ceilings that surround it. Stack can be seen by its use of space. The building is five levels high, and every level has a different purpose for the users. The main area surrounding the auditorium consists of books and sitting areas allowing people to enjoy the area without having to leave. The other floors have other purposes such as meeting rooms, lounges, and rooftop patios. Pixel can be seen in how the building is designed. It was designed around four other cultural buildings in the cultural district. The building also acts as a connector between different parts of the cultural district. Village can be seen in how community is promoted. The main atrium, including the spherical auditorium is bright and large, and promotes social aspects. People are encouraged to explore and enjoy the area while they are visiting.</p>
