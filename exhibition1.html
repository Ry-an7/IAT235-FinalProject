                <p>Designed by MVRDV in partnership with architects Natkaniec Olechnicki Architekci, Baltyk is MVRDV's first project in the country of Poland. Named after an old cinema that sat in the same location, it is a multi-functional tower that combines an office space, a one-room hotel, retail space, and a restaurant. Built in 2017, in the city center of Poznan, Baltyk takes inspiration from the historic city and creates its own story through the irregular design of the building. Its irregular design allows the building to tell a different story from all four sides it can be viewed from.</p>

            <div id="baltykPara2">
                <p> Baltyk is a 16-storey tower that features an offset arrangement of its floors. It was built in a way<br>that satisfies the owner's requests to connect the tower to the neighbourhood, and to make the connection between the different levels of the tower fluid. It also had to satisfy multiple different<br>city requirements, such as height and volume restrictions, smaller footprint because of its historic location, and accessible public space. The exterior of the tower is made up of glass windows and vertical strips of glass fiber concrete. The glass fiber concrete helps to absorb some of the sunlight to allow the building to have its large window views. To fit within the height and volume restrictions, Baltyk is built like a slope, with the base being thicker than the top. This gives the building a tower-like feeling from the thin top, as well as offering outdoor spaces from the terraces created by the offsetting floor arrangement.</p>

                <p>Viewers can look for the four design methodologies that MVRDV uses in Baltyk. Activator can be seen through the irregular shape of the tower. Having the irregular shape allows the building to have a different look from every angle, inviting viewers to go and see it from the different angles. Stack can be seen by the combination of different functions that the tower provides. It is not only an office tower, but contains different establishments stacked one on top of another. Pixel can be seen in and around the tower. The terraces created by the offset levels give outdoor space areas, and the large windows that the tower is made from allows generous amounts of sunlight in, as well as providing a view of the surrounding city. Village can be seen in how the tower was built. The glass fiber concrete is painted in colours that match the surrounding buildings, and the restaurant and the square around it creates social interactions, promoting community.</p>
