            <div class="aboutPara">
                <p class="aboutPage">Founded in 1993 by Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs and Nathalie de Vries, MVRDV is an architecture and urban design practice based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Their research-based design methodology is highly collaborative, involving their clients, stakeholders, and a variety of field experts from the early stages of a project. Their research-based design methodology is backed up by their research lab, The Why Factory. Developed by Winy Maas, this research lab theorises scenarios and finds solutions for them by building models and visualisations of future cities that can help address current and future societal problems.</p>

            <div class="langPara">
                <p class="aboutPage">Shown in an exhibition in 2019, Architecture Speaks: The Language of MVRDV, shows off their design methodologies that arise in every one of their projects. Viewers of their projects can look to find their four design methodologies: stack, pixel, village, and activator. Stack is their approach to connecting functions vertically to solve the ever-growing demand of space. Pixel can be seen in the design of buildings. It is the combination of functionality and flexibility of the building so that it can be used for what its intended as well as allowing others to enjoy it. Village is the idea that buildings should promote a sense of community, and Activator is how their architecture draw's people in to explore and experience their creations.</p>

            <div class="greenPara">
                <p class="aboutPage">Combating climate change though sustainability is one of the biggest driving factors in MVRDV's projects. MVRDV admits that climate change cannot be solved through a single project or technological fix therefore, their projects build off one another, as steps towards solving climate change. Through the use of environmentally sustainable materials and designs, their buildings are expertly crafted in ways to minimize the impact on the environment. The Green Dream, a book published by Winy Maas and The Why Factory, asks the question "Is a green city actually feasible?" It explores how their approach to a green city is different than the rest of the world, and it lists twenty-two critical observations that they have made about the current state of environmentally sustainable practices. MVRDV approaches their Green Dream as a phenomenon that can be measured, calculated, and evaluated from all different angles.</p>
